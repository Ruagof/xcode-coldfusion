Now that I am using Xcode 3 instead of Eclipse _(with loads of plugins)_, I am trying to get Codesense working with all aspects of Coldfusion.  Not seeing this anywhere else I am putting it here.

All information that I am using is based on [Adobe Coldfusion 8](http://adobe.com/support/coldfusion) and can be found in their support documentation.
